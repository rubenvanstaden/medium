# Focus

If you're going to change an area, you have to do three things; number one, your focus on it and you get a clear and compelling vision of what you want. If your body is not where you want it to be. I tell you, there is one simple reason. "No, no I focus on it. I focus all the time on how fat I am." No. See, if you focus on not trying to crash into the pole. The more you try not too, that's where your focus goes, that's where your energy goes, that's where you go. We all know that.

What I'm saying, is focus on what you want and not what you don't want. And it's not just about focusing on it. It's focusing on it and making it compelling. You can't just focus on it. You have to make a clear and compelling future on it. That will pull you towards it, so your not trying to push yourself.

If there's an area your not improving in, think of three pillars it you would.

1. Pillar one is, get focused and clear. What's compelling.
2. Where are you, really and don't lie.
3. Where do you want to be and make it so compelling you can't help it. When you wake up in the morning, you want to transform this area of your life.

The quality of your life is already better, cause your so excited about what your after. If you do that with your body or your emotions or finances of time or any other area. You're focusing and you're clear. You'll have energy and drive. You'll start to do things. How do you make sure what your doing really works, is model someone who is already successful. All the tools I've come up with, some of them I obviously created, but the foundation came by standing on the shoulders of giants. You know, I went out and found somebody who already has the results. Why reinvent the wheel success leaves clues. Find the best. Figure out what their doing. Do that. Alter it. Find your version of it. But start with what already is working, rather than starting from scratch and trile-and-error.

So emotion is it. If we can get the right emotion. We can get ourselves to do anything. If you don't have the money, but your creative and determined enough, you find a way. So this is the ultimate resource, but this is not the story people tell us. If decision shapens destiny, what determines it is three decisions. 1) What are you going to focus on. 2) The moment you decide what your going to focus on, you have to give it meaning. And what ever that meaning is, produces emotion which is the third part. And emotion then creates what we are going to do, or the action.

When your start to play this game and watching other people's emotions. Patterns becomes obvious. You see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way. Other people say; "aah that's ridiculous." No, it's simple. So what shapens you. Two invisible forces. 1) State. It wasn't your ability, it was your state. 2) Your model of the world is what shapens you long term. Your model of the world is the filter. That's what's shaping us. That's what makes people make decisions. If we want to influence somebody, we have to know what already influences them.

And it's made out of three parts I believe. 1) First, whats your target. It's need we have. 2) Second, once you know what the target that's driving you is. You uncover it. You don't form it. 3) Then you find out what's the map. What's the believe system that will tell you how to get those needs.
